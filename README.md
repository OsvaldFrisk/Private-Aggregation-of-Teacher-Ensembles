# Private-Aggregation-of-Teacher-Ensembles


This repository to implements the framework described by Papernot Et al. [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf), for training differentially private machine learning models. The framework only applies to a select few types, those that solve the classification problem for only a few classes (< 100).

For those interested in a less academic description of the paper, Nicolas Papernot and Ian Goodfellow (both authors of the paper) did a details [blog post](http://www.cleverhans.io/privacy/2018/04/29/privacy-and-machine-learning.html) on the paper and the relationship between differential privacy and machine learning.
